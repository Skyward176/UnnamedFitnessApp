# UpLift!

### The Problem
Working out is intimidating and mysterious to many beginners. Resources for fitness are often fragmented hidden behind paywalls or confusing. It can be hard to tell who is offering a good weightlifting plan and who is out to take your money. It can be hard to tell if you’re progressing with your fitness goals, which adds another obstacle to maintaining this important habit.

### My Solution
A website that allows users to create, share, and review routines. Users will also be able to track when they exercised, what routine they performed, how many reps and at what weight they performed them. This way, users can find reputable routines and track their progress in a streamlined, easy to understand way. Routines will be grouped by reccomended experience level, and reviews will show how long a user has been weight training to provide context.

### Project Objectives (Essential)
