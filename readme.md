# UpLift!

### The Problem
Working out is intimidating and mysterious to many beginners. Resources for fitness are often fragmented hidden behind paywalls or confusing. It can be hard to tell who is offering a good weightlifting plan and who is out to take your money. It can be hard to tell if you’re progressing with your fitness goals, which adds another obstacle to maintaining this important habit.

### My Solution
upLift, a website that allows user to create, share, view and review routines. 
This website allows users to find routines that match their needs, or to record routines that they create or find in a place that is always synchronized and easy to access anywhere.
In the future, upLift has the potential to grow into workout tracking and has room for many clever features such as integrated calculators for progressive overload, deloading, and one rep maximums.
