# General list of things I want to do this week
- Documentation housekeeping. Make updated database diagram to fit my database structure(for refrence).
- Completely rewrite timeline. 
- Make a ultra bare routine list to let me view, add, delete routines
- Use firebase security rules to restrict access to per-user basis
- Make the login/register pretty, make the navbar aware of login state(via auth context).
    - Login catches errors, register does appropriate validation of inputs
