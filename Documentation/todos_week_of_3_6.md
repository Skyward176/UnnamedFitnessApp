# General list of things I want to do this week
[x] Documentation housekeeping. Make updated database diagram to fit my database structure(for refrence).
[] Completely rewrite timeline. 
[x] Make a ultra bare routine list to let me view, add, delete routines
[x] Use firebase security rules to restrict access to per-user basis
[x] Make the login/register pretty, make the navbar aware of login state(via auth context).
[]Login catches errors, register does appropriate validation of inputs
