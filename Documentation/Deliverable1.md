# Unnamed Fitness Website
---

### System Definition:

The problem: Working out is intimidating and mysterious to many. Resources for fitness are often fragmented into many smaller solutions, hidden behind paywalls, or simply not user friendly. Leaving people looking to better themselves to their own devices adds challenge to what is already a difficult but important discipline to develop.

My solution: A website that allows users to create, share/sell, and review routines. Users will also be ableto track all exercises they have performed, how many reps, and other health data. They can subscribe to routines and be reminded of upcoming workouts. Intensity and weekly volume can all be graded, and the site will be able to provide feedback where it believes the user is over/under exerting themselves.
